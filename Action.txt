eats the last potato
borrows from a pessimist
prays for chicken tonight
praises false idols
smokes grass clippings
challenges the status quo
swims up a waterfall 
runs into gunfire
summons the Kraken
hates everyone
makes others happy
bangs seven gram rocks
is on a quest with a tinman
breaks the Geneva Convention
mercilessly beats seals
assaults young children
has Adonis blood
promotes polygamy
puts on clown makeup
asks a stupid question
plays Runescape
vandalizes playgrounds
sings worse than Yoko Ono
laughs at small people
writes dirty limericks
gave me the wrong number
listens to albums backwards
spits mad rhymes
enters a strangers van
watches porn in church
hugs me when I'm scared
listens to drone metal
masturbates on airplanes
knows judo well
steals rhubarb
illegally downloads movies
fucks with the Wu-Tang Clan
drives backwards on the motorway
indulges in sick fetishes
keeps off the grass
does sexual favours for cash
invests in Yugioh cards
makes Advice Animals
defies the laws of physics
dresses up as a nun
complains about the government
failed PE class
runs from difficult questions
preaches eugenics
picks bulbasaur as a starter
proclaims hip-hop is dead
wears Roman sandals
participates in midget tossing
cries in the rain
wacthes paint dry
seeks vengeance
covets thy neighbour
negotiates with terrorists
cant do math
is sleeping with a black man
opposes the establishment
doesn’t look before crossing the road
cares only about money
does vector calculus for fun
tortures animals for shits and giggles
sleeps under the freeway
says no to drugs
rubs against the grain
dreams for a better tomorrow
believes nothing is impossible
is grandwizard of the KKK
loves working for minimum wage
never gives up
lays with sheep
cooks crystal meth
gives in to peer pressure
writes Twilight fan-fiction
disrespects me
disrespects my crew
wants to kill me
thinks justice is unimportant
thinks the Holocaust never happened
believes Santa isnt real
has captured all 150 Pokemon
fucks the police
doesn’t attend my funeral
